# Kog architecture

Kog treats Cog as a behavioral oracle, not as an implementation constraint.
The Objective-C plugin boundary is replaced by a Rust decoder registry whose
backends may use safe Rust, C, or C++ libraries.

## Layers

1. **Qt Quick UI** recreates Cog's windows, toolbar, file tree, playlist,
   inspectors, menus, keyboard controls, drag-and-drop, and accessibility.
2. **CXX-Qt application models** expose only typed state and commands. QML
   never owns playback or decoder policy.
3. **Rust playback core** owns the playlist, decoder selection, transport,
   output device, timing, repeat/shuffle policy, and metadata.
4. **Decoder backends** probe a source and append decoded PCM to the shared
   mixer. Each backend declares seeking, subsongs, loop metadata, and companion
   file support independently.
5. **Native library adapters** isolate unsafe FFI and convert library-specific
   streams into interleaved floating-point PCM.

The installed backends are `rodio-symphonia` for conventional audio,
`midi-rustysynth-sf2` for Standard MIDI File and RIFF RMID rendering through a
user-selected SF2 SoundFont, and `midi-opl3windows` for the same MIDI containers
through Cog's OPL3Windows General MIDI engine and Nuked OPL3 1.7.1 core. They
provide real playback, pause, stop, seek, position, volume, and automatic
next-track behavior. Specialist backends remain separate so a broad fallback
cannot erase behavior such as PSF dependency resolution, VGMStream subsongs,
AdPlug subsongs, or emulator-authentic Roland MIDI synthesis.

Decoder settings are shared between the probe registry and playback registry.
The MIDI engine and current SF2 path are persisted in the platform
configuration directory; the SF2 is validated before it is accepted and cached
by path and modification time. Both MIDI engines render interleaved 48 kHz
stereo floating-point PCM. The OPL3 path uses a small C ABI around Cog's
GPL-compatible native engine; Midly merges format-0/1 tracks and schedules
legacy MIDI messages at exact output frames. Seeking recreates the selected
synthesizer and deterministically advances it to the requested frame.

## Decoder contract

`DecoderBackend` is the current executable contract. Every backend supplies:

- stable identifier and display name;
- extensions used for initial routing;
- explicit capability flags;
- a probe that returns duration, sample rate, and channel count;
- an append operation that gives the shared player a real decoded source.

The contract will grow before the first specialist backend to include source
sniffing, metadata, subsong enumeration, loop/fade policy, companion file
resolution, and deterministic error categories. Those additions must be made
without weakening the existing real playback path.

## Fidelity gates

- A versioned corpus must contain at least one independently redistributable
  sample for every decoder family and every behavior class.
- Format support requires successful probe, decode, audible PCM, duration,
  seek (when Cog supports it), metadata, and clean end-of-stream handling.
- Multi-track formats require exact subsong count and stable subsong identity.
- Looped game formats require loop and fade assertions, not just a timeout.
- Companion-file formats require both success and missing-dependency cases.
- UI parity is checked with deterministic rendered states against Cog reference
  captures at the same logical window size.
- Window and interaction coverage is tracked separately in
  [`UI_PARITY.md`](UI_PARITY.md); a visually similar main shell is not treated
  as whole-application UI parity.
- Linux, Windows, and macOS builds and runtime smoke tests are independent
  release gates.
